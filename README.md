Hi,

This is a Simple ToDo List App created using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB Server. It has various features like 
1) user creation, 
2) user login, 
3) user deletion, 
4) user updation, 
5) view user,
6) task addition, 
7) task updation,
8) task deletion,
9) view task as per user,

It has advanced methods like JWT Authentication, Password Hashing with Salt, User Specific task access and proper logging feature. 
Have also attached Thunderclient Collections file, so that you can directly test in your system.

Note: Am going to create frontend of this app (using react.js) as well very soon. So stay tuned!
